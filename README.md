# JavaScript Message Generator Program

## Description
This project was an off-platform exercise for Code Academy's full stack engineer program. I had the flexibility to select any type of messages, but was required to include a minimum of three messages. I ultimately decided on a digital fortune cookie.    

## Project Objectives
- Develop a message generator program using JavaScript;
- Use Git version control;
- Use command line interface; and
- Develop locally using MS Visual Studio Code.

## Features
- Provides today's fortune by randomly selecting one of 20 possible fortunes;
- Generates six, random lucky numbers between 0 and 100, exclusively; and
- Provides near- and long-term personal outlooks.
